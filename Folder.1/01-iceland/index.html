        <h1>4. Reykjavik</h1>
        <p>Starting as just a farmstead, to then having a population 140,000 (that's a little bit above a third of the population!) From the Sun Yoyager,to the Hallgrimskirkja church, to the Reykjavik Concert Hall, Perlan mueseum, local pools, Althing parliament, local bars & restaurants, there's so much to do in the capital! The best part is is that it's very easy to make your way around by foot!</p>

        <h1>5. Music</h1>
        <p>Everyone will know the big name: Björk. You may also have heard of Sigur Ros, Ásgeir, Of Monsters & Men, Múm, or even Kaleo. Iceland is renowned for releasing some of the most interesting and ecclectic music in the world, some of the artists have gone on to inspire new & old generations of musicians! When visiting be sure to add their songs to your playlist! From 'Hyperballad', to 'King & Cross', to 'Svefn-g-englar', to 'Way Down We Go', to 'Dirty Paws', you're bound to find at least something you will like! </p>

        <h1>6. The Language</h1>
        <p>Anyone who loves langugaes will know how notorious Icelandic can be to learn! But fear not if you don't know the language as the majority of Icelanders know english! Though if you go, make sure to learn some easy words or phrases (if you want to challenge yourself) to show your enthusiasm during your visit! Many locals will be very appreciative of this and are very welcoming! </p>

        <h1>7. Geysers & Hot Springs</h1>
        <p>Iceland is a very young country geographically, which means that the ground is also very hot! Causing natural phenominons like gerysers and hot springs to occur whereby water is heated from the ground naturally! Sometimes these result in geysers whereby water will shoot out of the ground every few minutes! If you don't believe us, go see them for yourselves!</p>
